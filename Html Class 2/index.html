        <p>In the rest of the chapter you
            will meet some more elements
            that will help you when you are
            adding text to web pages. For
            example, you are going to meet
            the <em> element that allows
                you to indicate where emphasis
                should be placed on selected
                words and the blockquote
                element which indicates that a
                block of text is a quotation.
                Browsers often display the
                contents of these elements in
                a different way. For example,
                the content of the em
                element is shown in italics,
                and a blockquote is usually
                indented. But you should not
                use them to change the way that
                your text looks; their purpose is
                to describe the content of your
                web pages more accurately.
                The reason for using these
                elements is that other programs,
                such as screen readers or search
                engines, can use this extra
                information. For example, the
                voice of a screen reader may add
                emphasis to the words inside
                the em element, or a search
                engine might register that your
                page features a quote if you use
                the blockquote element.</p>
